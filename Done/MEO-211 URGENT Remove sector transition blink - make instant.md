# [MEO-211] URGENT: Remove sector transition blink - make instant

**Status:** Done

---

## Problem

When navigating between sectors, there is a visible blink/flash. The transition effect causes the map to fade out then fade in, which is visually jarring.

## Required Behavior

* Sector transitions should be INSTANT
* No fade, no blink, no flash
