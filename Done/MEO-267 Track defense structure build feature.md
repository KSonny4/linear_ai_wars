# [MEO-267] Track defense structure build feature

**Status:** Done

---

## Summary

* Introduce a `/planets/{planetId}/structures` endpoint for building stationary defense structures
* Add domain/model updates so defense turrets are stored separately from ships and contribute to combat
* Update API docs, [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md), and e2e tests so the new flow is visible to agents
