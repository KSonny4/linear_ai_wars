# [MEO-242] Defense System Overhaul: Stationary Turrets + Ally Reinforcements

**Status:** Done

---

## Overview

Add a proper defense system with:

1. **Stationary Defense Turrets** - Can't be sent on missions, only defend
2. **Enhanced Support Missions** - Send reinforcements to ally planets

## Why

Currently all ships can both attack and defend. This makes defense strategy shallow. Adding stationary turrets creates meaningful choices.
